Instructions:

1. Create a division for your nested list. Give it the class cssmenu and an id of your choice. 
   (In index.html we have used 'menu')
2. Similarly create a division for social icons and give it an id.

3. In your navigation list (ul list) point your anchor tags to the created divs by giving them the ids of the divs.

4. In the div for the nested menu create nested lists.

		<ul>
			<a></a>
			<li><a></a></li>
			<li>
				<a></a>
				<ul>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
   If an li element contains a list give it the class has-sub. Make sure that you include the contents of the anchor
   tag in a <span> element.
   
 5. For the social icons just create an <ul> list and in the anchor tags within the elements include your image tags for
    social media icons.
    
 6. In the head tag include mobiMenu.css
 
 7. Before the </body> tag include jquery.js mobiMenu.js and modernizr.js (Always use the .min versions in production)


 8. Create a script tag after including all necessary javascript files and in their invoke the plugin on your <nav> like this
 
		$(document).ready(function() {

				$("topNav").mobiMenu();

			});
			
    Where topNav is the class of the <nav> element
